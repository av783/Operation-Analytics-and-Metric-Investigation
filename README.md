# Operation-Analytics-and-Metric-Investigation
This project analyzes operational data to investigate metrics spikes and user engagement using SQL queries.

Project Description:
This Operational Analytics project aims to analyse end-to-end operations data for a company like Microsoft. In this various teams such as operations, support, marketing etc are involved with analysts to gain insights from the datasets provided. The project involves two main case studies: Job Data Analysis and Investigating Metric Spike. These analyses will help in key metrics such as a dip in daily user engagement, a drop in sales, or user growth analysis etc.

Approach:
Data Exploration and Preparation:
First of all, the database provided helps identify relatable tables that will help deal with the users’ data. Then with the help of concerned schemas, the project’s work is carried on.
SQL Queries to analyse:
Now, I have curated a list of SQL queries executed to help visualise the users’ data.
Documentation and Reporting:
Finally, I have created a report compiling all the queries extracting user information and providing insights and actionable recommendations. 

Tech-Stack Used:
The software used in tackling this project is:
MYSQL Workbench: With its help, SQL queries are run and the database is managed.
SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS): This was rarely used for additional database management tasks.
MS Word: It is used to form the report where the project’s documentation is reported.
